      <h3> <u>Plot</u> </h3>
      <p> When Shoyo Hinata happens by a TV in the window of a store in Japan, he witnesses a Karasuno High School volleyball player known as "The Little Giant" take the spotlight on the national stage. Inspired, he begins playing volleyball and even attends Karasuno in order to emulate his rival. What he lacks in height and technical skill, he makes up for in endurance and athleticism, which the genius setter Tobio Kageyama, his rival and best friend, is able to make full use of. The series follows the team as they aim for the top at the Spring National Tournament.

      <h3> <u>Characters</u> </h3>
      <p> The characters in <em>Haikyuu!!</em> are all masterfully crafted. Furudate goes to great lengths to establish everyone's motivations, strenghts, weaknesses, and backstories even if they're on the opposing team. Below are short descriptions of the three of the main protagonists in the series.</p>
      <h4> Shoyo Hinata </h4>
      He's short, doesn't have great technique, but he has alot of spunk and atheticsm. Isnpired to become a player like Karasuno's "Little Giant" from their famous nationals run years ago, he joins their volleyball team. He quickly learns what it really means to be part of team and is on a constant journey of self improvement and ever growing love for the sport.
      <h4> Tobio Kageyama </h4>
       He's the "King of the Court", a setter with a genius level of technical ability. However his great skill and attiutude demanded too much from his middle-school teammates and they ostracized him. In high school, he meets Shoyo, someone who finally has the athleticism to keep up with his best sets and who challenges his to become the best he can be. 
      <h4> Kei Tsukishima </h4>
      <p> Kei is introduced into the story as the tallest freshman on the team. He's cool, calm, and collected with a dash of pompous arragance towards his other teammates, especially Tobio and Shoyo. He's dispassionate and complacent when it comes to volleyball, which is in stark contrast to many other characters. However, over the course of the first few story arcs, he slowly develops his own unique skillset and grows closer and closer to "his moment": when he finally gets hooked on volleyball.</p>
